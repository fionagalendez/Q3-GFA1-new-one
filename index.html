	<h1>Preservation of Coral Reefs</h1>

	<p>Reefs have been an aid in the advancement of our society. They have done it in multiple aspects, like being able to feed half a billion people. They also protect coastal communities during storms as they act as a barrier that slows down water flow. They are waterâ€™s natural filters which means they help keep it clean. And they can help advance tourism in local communities as tourists flock over to see their magnificence every year.</p>

	<p>With all this, I invite you to join my advocacy group that aims for the protection and conservation of coral reefs across the world. If you are part of the ones who are willing to take on a new environmental challenge, join us. I would love to see all of you soon!</p>
